            <p>Yes Green Fashion Limited  & the Strength of Knitwear Sector in Bangladesh.
              Competitive wage rate together with easily trainable workforce, entrepreneurial skill, expanding supply side capacity, and government policy support helped to translate the comparative advantages into competitive advantages. The core strength of the knitwear sector is its backward linkage. The entrepreneurs of the sector not only increased their stitching capacity overtime but also invested in the allied industry to augment the overall capacity of the total sector with the same pace. Over the period knitwear sector gradually became almost self sufficient in fabric and yarn. This improvement has become possible because of the integrated growth of spinning factories in line of the growth of country’s stitching capacity and increased need of the yarn and fabric.</p>
